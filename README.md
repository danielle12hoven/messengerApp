# General Assembly NY Chat App
##What does our app do?
   * Visit https://radiant-fortress-11127.herokuapp.com/ to use our app!
   * It allows the user to login to our chatroom, and post messages to alert the local
     NY campus about stuff.
   * There is no local storage, so you can only see the chat log that's been updated since the last
     time you reloaded the chat page.
   * It finds the user location so it can only be used in the vicinity of the NY GA campus.
   
## Technologies Used   
   
   * 'comeonin' was the password hashing library we used to enforce password security.
   * We used the javascript GeoLocation to authenticate the user's location.
